Bam has a serries of automated tests and strives for a decent amount of code coverage to ensure that no changes will introduce regression issues. If you are submitting a PR make sure that the existing tests all pass and any new behaviours your PR is adding is covered by their own set of tests. To run the tests use the `npm run lint` and `npm test` commands.
